# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. 
The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE was applied to balance the classes. 
Logistic Regression was used to build the classification model.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes major financial losses. Fraud transactions are rare, 
making detection challenging. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- Features: Time, Amount, V1–V28 (PCA transformed)
- Target: Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)
5. Model Evaluation

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC

## ✅ Results
The model successfully classified fraudulent and legitimate transactions, 
demonstrating the importance of handling class imbalance.
